Software Development Lifecycle

Students will explore the stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) through the lens of developers and testers to examine the characteristics, documentation, and purpose of each stage. Through applying SDLC stages within an agile development environment, students will learn the principles and best practices used to develop high quality software while also assessing the impact of communication, documentation, and ethics on the SDLC.


How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are gathered via interviews and requirements lists from the client. Working directly with the client will determine what their needs are for a program. These features are then categorized and assigned to user stories. Each story tells a concise tale of a feature the client would like to implement. User stories help to capture the information necessary to complete a feature in the final product. They also make it easier to assign an estimate of the effort needed to complete each feature.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

What agile processes I incorporate will be largely dependent on where I end up working. Each company will have its own idea of how to implement agile, so I will need to work within whatever framework they have already developed. Of course, I can always make suggestions, or perhaps help to implement agile if it is not already in place. For my individual work in developing programs, agile processes such as sprint planning and creating user stories will be very beneficial to accomplishing tasks by helping me to stay organized and on task. I would also like to employ some of the tools discussed in this course to help track tasks and organize work and communication within my team.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member must be an effective communicator, and must therefore be open and honest in their communications. They must also be aware and understanding of their team's strengths and weaknesses, finding ways to leverage strenghs for the good of the team while also adapting to any weaknesses, or trying to help teammates overcome them. This can be through a number of practices, such as mentoring and sharing personal knowledge and experience. I also think it is important to focus on how your role can benefit the team and the final product, not just your own interests.
